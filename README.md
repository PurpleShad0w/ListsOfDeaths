### Terminology for Character Statuses

- **deceased** - the character stayed dead.
- **alive** - the character did not die or did not stay dead.
- - **revived**      - this death was nullified when the character was brought back from the dead.
- - **reincarnated** - this death was nullified when the character was reborn with their memories.
- - **undone**       - this death was nullified via time travel.
- - **non-canon**    - this death happened, but is not considered canon when it comes to the character's status.
- **dependent** - the character may or may not be deceased depending on certain factors.
- - **determinant** - this death happening depends upon a player's choice.
- - **continuant**  - this death exists but not in every adaptation of a story, and the character's canonical status is unspecified.
- - **unavoidable** - this death happens differently depending upon a choice but always happens nonetheless.
- **extant** - the character is arguably deceased yet still remains due to specific circumstances.
- - **physical**   - this death concerns only a character's body, leaving their mind or soul alive.
- - **brain-dead** - this death left the character only physically alive, with no brain activity possible.
- - **undead**     - this death turned the character into an undead being such as a zombie or a ghost.
- **variants** - the 'character' refers here to a cumulative summary of all different versions of a character.
